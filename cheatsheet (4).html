        <br><b>Main Developer:</b> Tim Berners Lee
        <br><b>First IP-Connection:</b> 1988 between Europe and North America

        <br><p>In 1990 the Hypertextproject WorldWideWeb which was a web of hypertext-documents was released

        <br><i>The URL (uniform resource locator) and URI(uniform resource identifier) are a system for (globally unique) identifiers for resources on the Web</i>

        <br><p><i>HTML is the short version of <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage
        <br>HTTP is the short version of <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol</i></p>

        The URL is often confused with the URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) even thoug it's just a specific form of an URI.

        <article>
        <br><p><i>The syntax can be very simple or a little bit complicated, it completely depends on the specifix URL. For example it could be scheme:path which is the simplest form.
        <br>After the scheme: you can add //host and after path "?[query]"so it would be scheme://host path?query.
        <br>After the // we can add userinfo@ and after the host you can add :port so it finally would be scheme://userinfo@host:portpath?query
        <br>Some possibles schemes are http, https and ftp.</p></i></article>
